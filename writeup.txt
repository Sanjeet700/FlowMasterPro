FlowMaster Pro: AI-Powered M365 Task Suggester

Problem: Microsoft 365 users are overwhelmed by emails and meetings, losing track of critical tasks.

Solution: FlowMaster Pro is an AI agent that scans M365 emails and calendars, suggesting prioritized tasks via a Teams bot. This prototype extracts a task (“prepare slides”) from a mock email, mimicking M365 data with a hardcoded output to simulate Azure AI Text Analytics. The console output represents a Teams bot reply.

Tech Stack: Python, mock data simulating M365. Planned: M365 Agents SDK for real email/calendar integration, Azure AI for NLP, Teams bot for delivery.

Impact: Saves time for professionals by surfacing key tasks. Scalable to team workflows, enhancing M365’s productivity ecosystem.

Challenges: Time constraints limited this to a console prototype with mock data due to a late start. Future versions would add M365 SDK and sentiment-based prioritization.

Solo Effort: Built in 2 hours, leveraging my AI expertise to showcase Microsoft’s potential.
